# ClassKitIntegration
A simple demonstration project for ClassKit in Objective-C

See LessonDatabase.m for more information about how the class works.  This demo provides (I believe)
everything you need to get started with ClassKit, showing how to simulate a launch from the SchoolWork app
and how to integrate your apps lesson structure with the CLSActivity API in ClassKit.
